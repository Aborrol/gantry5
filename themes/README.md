Gantry Themes
=============

## Common

Common folder consists of all the content that is shared between all platforms. We can also call this our base theme.

## Grav

Native Grav template.

## Joomla

Native Joomla 3.4 template.

## Standalone

Not done yet, but here's the idea:

Standalone template which can be used to develop the template as it should contain enough test pages to get the general look done, but also to allow us to do general, platform independent testing. Could contain a collection of static pages made with simple php, html and yaml.

## WordPress

Native WordPress 2.0 template.
