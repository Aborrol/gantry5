## Installing Gantry 5 and the Hydrogen Theme

Gantry 5 is a framework by which Gantry-powered themes are made. In order for a Gantry theme to work, you will need to install both the **framework** and the **theme**. Doing this is not difficult at all.

The first thing you need to do is download the latest build of Gantry 5 and Hydrogen. You can do so by clicking the links below, or via [GitHub](http://github.com/gantry/gantry5/).

* [Download Gantry 5](https://github.com/gantry/gantry5/releases/download/5.0.0-beta.1/joomla-pkg_gantry5_v5.0.0-beta.1.zip)
* [Download Hydrogen Theme](https://github.com/gantry/gantry5/releases/download/5.0.0-beta.1/joomla-tpl_g5_hydrogen_v5.0.0-beta.1.zip)

>>> During the initial beta, the **Framework** and **Template** are being distributed in different installable packages. A bundled package is planned, but will likely be available after the initial beta launch.

Once you have the latest packages, installation is simple. We have provided a step-by-step guide in the **Installation** portion of this documentation.

## Accessing the Gantry Administrator

### Joomla 
When you have installed and activated both the Gantry framework and Hydrogen, you can access the Gantry 5 administrator in several different ways. The easiest being simply navigating to **Components > Gantry 5 Templates** from the back end of Joomla.

Here, you will see a list of any installed Gantry-powered themes. You can **Preview** the theme from here or select **Configure** to go directly to the **Gantry Administrator** where you can get started modifying your Gantry-powered site.

## Navigating the Gantry 5 Administrator

The Gantry Administrator has multiple administrative tools you can flip through to configure how your Gantry-powered theme looks and functions. Here is a quick breakdown of each of these tools, and what you can do with them.

You will notice the following menu items in the Gantry 5 Administrator:

1. **Menu Editor**: This administrative panel gives you the ability to enhance the platform's menu by altering styling, rearranging links, and creating menu items that sit outside of the CMS's integrated Menu Manager.    
    
2. **About**: This page gives you quick, at-a-glance information about the currently-accessed theme. This is a one-stop shop for information about the theme including: name, version number, creator, support links, features, and more.

3. **Platform Settings**: This button takes you to the CMS' settings page for Gantry 5. In Joomla, this is the **Permissions** configuration page.

4. **Clear Cache**: This button clears the cache files related to Gantry. This includes all of the temporary files outside of CSS and configuration information.

5. **Configuration Dropdown**: This dropdown makes it easy to quickly switch between Configurations without having to leave the Gantry Administrator.

6. **Styles**: This administrative panel gives you access to style related configuration settings. This includes things like theme colors, fonts, style presets, and more.

7. **Settings**: This administrative panel offers you the ability to configure the functional settings of the theme. This includes setting defaults for Particles, as well as enabling/disabling individual Particles.

8. **Layout**: This administrative panel is where you would configure the layout for your theme. Creating an placing module positions, Particles, spacers, and non-rendered scripts such as Google Analytics code is all done in this panel.

## What are Configurations, Particles, Atoms, etc.?

Because Gantry 5 is so different from any version of Gantry before it, we came up with some terms to help make sense of the relationships Gantry's new features have with one-another. Here is a quick breakdown of commonly used terms related to Gantry 5.

| Term          | Definition                                                                                                                                             |
| :-----        | :-----                                                                                                                                                 |
| Configuration | A configurable style used in one or more areas of your site. It serves as the container on which a page's style, settings, and layout are set.         |
| Particle      | A typically small block of data used on the front end. It acts a lot like a widget/module, but can be easily configured in the Gantry 5 Administrator. |
| Atom          | A type of Particle that contains non-rendered data, such as custom scripting (JS, CSS, etc.) or analytics scripts for traffic tracking.                |
